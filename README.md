### FAQs

#### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

Mark down is better than word processor because it is simple and easy to use. You can learn in quickly and it has better readability. Also, mark down is compatible with HTML which makes it even better.

#### Why is my resume not showing up?

There can be multiple reasons why your resume is not showing up on Github. The most common reason is that github is still processing it to get it hosted on your website. Another reason for it might be that there is a spelling error when you are looking up your website or you are looking it up incorrectly. Lastly, we want to make sure that our repository is public.
