## Purpose

This project aims to not only host a resume using GitHub Pages by adhering to the principles outlined in Andrew Etter's Modern Technical Writing but also teaches how to do so. 

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools:

- The first task for us is to create a GitHub or Codeberg account

- Secondly we would like to install a Markdown editor of our choice so that we can write our resume.

- A Static site generator which is completely optional.

## Instructions

There were several layers to this project:

- Download a text editor that is compatible with Markdown syntax (R studio). 
  
  - To do this you can simply go to Google and type in the "download" and the name of the editor you would like to use
  
  - Click on the first link and download your editor

- Once you have download R, write down the Resume using Markdown utilizing its clear and concise formatting. Try to focus on Github flavored markdown 

- Once the resume was completed, create a Github account,

  - To do this go to [Github](Github.com) and click on sign up.
  
  - Enter all the necessary details and your account will be created.

- Create your repository on your github account. 

  - To do this click on "new repository" on the top right hand corner of the page
  
  - The repository is named as myusername.github.io. Please make sure to use your username when naming it and make it public. 
  
  - For example, my username is Huzzaifaa, hence my repository's name would be Huzzaifaa.github.io

- Upload your Markdown documents namely the "Resume" and "README" on the repository.  

- Lastly, access your github page link (make sure that it is hosted) to access your hosted resume.  

  - To make sure the page is hosted, you can always click on "actions" tab and it will tell you if its still being processed or not.

## FAQs

###  Can I Add Additional Pages to My Resume Website?

Yes, you can definitely add additional pages to your resume, all you have to do is add whatever you would like to in your mark down file and upload it on Github. Make sure that it has the same name as the file you would like to replace and you would have additional pages on the website 

### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

Mark down is better than word processor because it is simple and easy to use. You can learn in quickly and it has better readability. Also, mark down is compatible with HTML which makes it even better. You can write things in markdown multiple times faster than in a word processor. Markdown's compatibility also adds to it being a preference over word processor as it is very flexible and you can write it in any text editor that supports plain text such as a simple text document. 

### Why is my resume not showing up?

There can be multiple reasons why your resume is not showing up on Github. The most common reason is that github is still processing it to get it hosted on your website. Another reason for it might be that there is a spelling error when you are looking up your website or you are looking it up incorrectly. Lastly, we want to make sure that our repository is public because if it isn't public, we will be unable to locate your resume.
