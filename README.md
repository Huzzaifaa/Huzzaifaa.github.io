## Purpose

This project aims to give step by step instructions on how to host your resume online from scratch. It also follows Etter's Principle's of Technical Writing providing clear and concise steps on how to host the resume on Github pages. 

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools:

- The first task for us is to create a GitHub or Codeberg account

- Secondly we would like to install a Markdown editor of our choice so that we can write our resume.

- A Static site generator such as Jekyll which will help us choose themes for our online page.

## Instructions

There were several layers to this project:

- Download a text editor that is compatible with Markdown syntax (R studio). 
  
  - To do this you can simply go to Google and type in the "download" and the name of the editor you would like to use
  
  - Click on the first link and download your editor

- Once you have download R, write down the Resume using Markdown utilizing its clear and concise formatting. Try to focus on Github flavored markdown as it is very easy and clear to use. 

- Once the resume was completed, create a Github account,

  - To do this go to [Github](Github.com) and click on sign up.
  
  - Begin with entering the email you would like to create your account with
  
  - Enter your password and then confirm it 
  
  - This should allow you to create your github account.

- Create your repository on your github account. 

  - To do this click on "new repository" on the top right hand corner of the page
  
  - The repository is named as myusername.github.io. Please make sure to use your username when naming it and make it public. 
  
  - For example, my username is Huzzaifaa, hence my repository's name would be Huzzaifaa.github.io
  
  - Please make sure that your repository is public or else we will have issues in accessing your resume online. this can be done by going into the general sections of the settings page and scrolling down a bit. 
  
  - Lastly we would also make sure that the branch is name as "main".

- Upload your Markdown documents namely the "Resume" and "README" on the repository.  

  - There are 2 ways to do this. You can either drag your documents from the folders they are located in or you can click on the "browse" button and upload them. 
  
  - Once you have successfully uploaded our documents, we would like to click on "commit changes" button which is on the top right hand side of the page.

- Lastly, access your github page link (make sure that it is hosted) to access your hosted resume.  

  - To make sure the page is hosted, you can always click on "actions" tab and it will tell you if its still being processed or not.
  
  - To access the pages online, the main branch can be directly accessed by entering 'your username'.github.io whereas other files can be accessed by adding a forward slash in front 'your username'.github.io followed by the      name of the file

## FAQs

###  Can I Add Additional Pages to My Resume Website?

Yes, you can definitely add additional pages to your resume, all you have to do is add whatever you would like to in your mark down file and upload it on Github. Make sure that it has the same name as the file you would like to replace and you would have additional pages on the website. You can do this however many times you would like to. 

### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

Mark down is better than word processor because it is simple and easy to use. You can learn in quickly and it has better readability. Also, mark down is compatible with HTML which makes it even better. You can write things in markdown multiple times faster than in a word processor. Markdown's compatibility also adds to it being a preference over word processor as it is very flexible and you can write it in any text editor that supports plain text such as a simple text document. 

### Why is my resume not showing up?

There can be multiple reasons why your resume is not showing up on Github. The most common reason is that github is still processing it to get it hosted on your website. Another reason for it might be that there is a spelling error when you are looking up your website or you are looking it up incorrectly. Another reason for it would include is that there is an error in the page being deployed, this can refer to many issues which may include an error in branch or the markdown file.  Lastly, we want to make sure that our repository is public because if it isn't public, we will be unable to locate your resume.
